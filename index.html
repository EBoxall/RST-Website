  <h2> Before the NFL </h2>
    <img src ="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9d/18/16/9d1816b79b35e9085f067fcf730c16ad.jpg" align="right">
  <p>
    Before the conception of the NFL,<br> Football teams were regional and often played amongst different areas of the United States. However over time, a group in Canton, Ohio (Where the current NFL Hall of Fame is located.) decided to create a league consisting of different state teams to participate in what we now know as the National Football League, this started the first era of professional football. Consisting of only five teams from Ohio, four teams from Illinois, two teams from Indiana, two teams from New York and Finally a single team from Michigan. Today, only two of these original teams still exist and thirty more teamns have been added over the course of a hundred years.

  <h2> The Greatest Game Ever Played </h2>
  <p>
    On April 21, 1958, their was a massive boost in popularity towards the sport of American Football and one game sparked the fire of popularity that we see it have today. In a game between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants,millions of people watched the game go on and sparked the new era of football, the game was so fascinating and exciting to watch it was dubbed "The Greatest Game Ever Played" by its viewers. However, in the shadows of popularity cast by the NFL, another footbal league was also steadily growing in its own popularity.

  <h2> The NFL vs. The AFL </h2>
  <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/AmericanFootballLeague.png" align = "left">
  <img class = "nfllfix" src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/National_Football_League_logo.svg/1200px-National_Football_League_logo.svg.png" align = "right">
  <p>
    The AFL (or the American Football League) was considered the younger brother of the NFL, being founded just after "The Greatest Game Ever Played" popularity rose due to the AFL taking many teams from west coast regions and other regions that were not picked to play in the NFL. After four attempts prior before 1959 the AFL finally got traction in the football world and was ready to take just as much attention as the NFL. However, the owners of the NFL teams saw this as an oppurtunity to allow both leagues to gain massive traction among sports fans. The Superbowl. The Superbowl was originally the best team from the NFL and the best team from the AFL would play in a grand match to decide which team from the two leagues was the best. After five very popular and succesful Superbowls, the two leagues decided to join together under the already extremely popular and grown NFL name and produce the NFL as we know it today.
